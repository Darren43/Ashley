                These few examples only touch the tip of the iceberg. Is it any wonder then that this 21 year old girl cooperated? They told her they knew it was not her. They told her they would help her if she signed.
                <br> <br> Then she got handed a death sentence anyway.

                Ashley's lawyers all proved to be scoundrels. Mike Greene out of BKK promised to fly to Koh Samui directly to get Ashley out on bail after he was paid 95,000 Baht. He was paid but never got on a plane.
                <br> <br> He then forged a document which he claimed to be from the provencial court demanding a 2 million baht bail be delivered in cash, plus his fee.

                It looks much better to have the drugs coming from somewhere else. Tristan used Hot in the Biscuit for less than 6 weeks to import drugs. He used Panyadee for well more than a hundred. So why is Ashley the one in chains?

                <br> Ashley used to be allowed to have phone calls with friends and family. Ashley used to be allowed up to ten books per month. She used to be allowed to be sent letters.
                <br> However in the middle of the night on December 29th, 2021, guards came to her cell. They forcibly packed her up and sent her to another prison on the mainland despite her appeal being ongoing where she was then immediately put into

                Please, make this your fight. Ashley needs your help now more than ever. She is only 22 years old. Right now as you read these words she languishes in a Thai prison cell where she does not even understand the words spoken for a crime she had nothing to
                do with. She has not been heard from by anyone for over two months. She is not allowed books, letters, or calls.
                <br> <br> Won't you please help Ashley Oosthuizen?
                <br> <br> Please, at least share this website and her story and if you are able to do more, she would be most grateful if you did. Be well assured that she is certainly worth it. Thank you for your help, compassion, and time.
